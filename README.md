# 07 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

## Description

This project required us developers to work collaboratively on a project to solve a real-world problem. We implemented a user story and mock-up as a guidline to develop an app that allows the user to input ingredients that they have on hand and the app will five recipe buttons with suggested recipes based on user ingredient submission. The user can then click the recipe button to generate an image, ingredients required, and detailed instructions on preparation. The app features two APIs, one for recipe generation and another for food related quotes.

## Tasks 

- Implemented Spoonacular API to render recipe image, ingredients and instructions.
- Implemented API Ninja to display a random food-based quote.
- The app was styled using Bulma CSS framework.
- Worked collaboratively with a group of three developers.
- Used issues on a kanban project board and branches to delegate work.
- Implemented local storage to store the last five recipes the user generated.
